# Overview

For this project, I attempted to create a functional website. This website was designed to be a currency converter with interactable buttons to take a user from page to page, as well as user input in order to get a desired currency.

The webapp itself is quite simple and built off of previously gained JavaScript knowledge. It utilizes an API call in order to get information from a third party service which is then used in the conversion process. It seperates the JavaScript code from the html code in order to keep the moving parts seperate and it also has styalistic chocies which can be found in the .css file. In order to use this please go to the currency_converter.html site first, then select currencies to convert. Once selected the page which switch to the display page with a go back button in order to reset the website. 

The purpose in writing this software was to fully integrate my knowledge of Node.js as well as JavaScript in order to develop a full sized (if rudimentary) web application which can run on its own, were I to publish it. It was as well to further my knowledge of web development and how I could develop my own sites or sites for others in the future.

# Web Pages

- First Page: List of Currencies and Conversion Mechanism. Descriptions of how to use the Converter. (parent page)
- Second Page: Display of Resulting Conversion: Displays resulting Conversion, changes based on user input from first page. Will not move on to second page unless user inputs data.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this website were Node.js, which is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. I also utilized vsCode as the platform as well as livesever in order to see what the code would look like if it were translated to a website format. I also utilized an API which functioned to generate the numbers nessecary for a correct conversion based off of current currency figures.

The programming language which I used was JavaScript which is widley recognized as a language oriented towards web development. Its Node.js runtime environment is quite usefull in said development and its cross platform compatability allow it to be used in a wide array of server-side applications.

# Future Work

* More Interactivity (a game or something else)
* Better Styalistic Choices
* More information on publishing as fully developed website (how to get it off of vsCode)
